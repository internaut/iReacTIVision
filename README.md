iReacTIVision
=============

Description
-----------

This repository contains a modified version of the *reacTIVision* framework (see http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/), which is an open source, cross-platform computer vision framework for table-top Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs). iReacTIVision (note the small *i*) is a modified version of this framework which runs on iOS devices. With it, it is possible to create a very compact and portable low cost Tangible User Interface based on a tablet computer.

More information can be found [on a dedicated project page](http://mkonrad.net/Projects/IPad2TUI) on [my homepage] (http://mkonrad.net/). I also wrote a [paper](http://mkonrad.net/uploads/Projects/coursework-ipad2tui-konrad.pdf) about this project as part of my studies.

Supported devices
-----------------

So far, the software was tested on Apple's iPad (2nd and 3rd generation), but should also run on an iPhone or other iOS devices (with small modifications).
