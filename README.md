iReacTIVision
=============

Description
-----------

This repository contains a modified version of the `reacTIVision` framework (see http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/), which is an open source, cross-platform computer vision framework for table-top Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs). iReacTIVision (note the small `i`) is a modified version of this framework which runs on iOS devices. With it, it is possible to create a very compact and portable low cost Tangible User Interface based on a tablet computer.

A small paper will later be published that covers the topic in more detail.

Supported devices
-----------------

So far, the software only was tested on Apple's iPad 2, but should also run on an iPhone or other iOS devices (with small modifications).
